# Optimized MediatR Library

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Optimized MediatR Library**! This project is a performance-enhanced version of the popular [MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) library. Built purely for fun and experimentation, the goal of this library is to maintain the familiar features of MediatR while delivering improved efficiency and speed.

## Features

- **Optimized Performance:** Enhanced internal mechanisms to reduce latency and improve the throughput of request handling.
- **Compatibility:** Designed to be a drop-in replacement for MediatR with minimal or no changes required to your existing codebase.
- **Extensible:** Retains the flexibility and extensibility that MediatR users love, making it easy to adapt to various application needs.
- **Lightweight:** Keeps the footprint small and dependencies minimal, ensuring a lean integration.
